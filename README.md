üëã

I am a Tech Trainee with [La Fosse](https://www.lafosseacademy.com/), currently looking forward to an exciting placement with a technology partner üöÄ

I write articles to help people use new technologies: [medium.com/@hortfrancis](https://medium.com/@hortfrancis)

I am a strong self-directed learner: [teamtreehouse.com/profiles/hortfrancis](https://teamtreehouse.com/profiles/hortfrancis)

I love experimenting with CSS in the browser: [codepen.io/hortfrancis](https://codepen.io/hortfrancis/) 

I currently live in Norwich, UK. 

- _Currently learning:_ **React**, **Express**, **Postgres**, **Python & Flask**, **Docker**
- _Currently building:_ **Node** spikes to investigate how to integrate language models via the **OpenAI API** into web applications.

## Education
- üéì I am currently studying **User Experience Design** at Norwich University of the Arts in my spare time. 
- üñ• I studied **Web Development** on a bootcamp with HyperionDev (grade: 99%).  
- üîí I studied **Cyber Security** at a postgraduate level at the University of East Anglia. 
- üéÆ I studied **Games Art & Design** for my undergraduate degree at Norwich University of the Arts

## Projects 

- [**Laravel Reflection**](https://github.com/hortfrancis/laravel-reflection)
  - Full-stack 'company management app' built in Laravel (PHP) that applies CRUD operations and RESTful actions on companies and employees, stored in a MySQL database. Blade components with Tailwind CSS render the user interface.
- [**Netmatters Homepage**](https://github.com/hortfrancis/netmatters-homepage)
  - While training full-time with the IT company Netmatters, I built a replica of their homepage from scratch over a couple of months, adding responsive styling, interactivity with JavaScript, and server-side functionality (serving data from a database and processing contact form submissions) with PHP.
- [**Array Reflection**](https://github.com/hortfrancis/array-reflection)
  - Vanilla JavaScript project that fetches an image from an API, and allows a user to assign it to an email address, with front-end validation and custom 'neomorphic' interactivity styling. 
- [**Cash Balance Manipulator**](https://github.com/hortfrancis/cash-balance-manipulator)
  - A web user interface for manipulating a cash balance, built in React, with Redux for state management. Along with adding or subtracting an amount to the balance, the user can add interest at a fixed rate of 5% or apply a charge to the balance at a fixed rate of 15%. 
- [**To Do App**](https://github.com/hortfrancis/to-do-app)
  - Front-end application using React, with Redux for state management. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, and can mark tasks as 'done'. 

## Generative AI 
I specialise in using: 
- [**ChatGPT-4**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) for text content generation, problem solving, and to support my learning.  
- [**Midjourney**](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) to generate high-quality images very quickly. 
- [**ElevenLabs**](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) to create AI-generated text-to-speech audio.

## Methodology explorations

- ['**Hollow functions**'](https://github.com/hortfrancis/hollow-function-documentation)
  - A proposed functional programming technique to integrate 'on the spot' reasoning from language models in a predictable, programmatic way.
- [**FileStruc Notation**](https://github.com/hortfrancis/filestruc)
  - A standardised syntax for describing file structures within digital projects, to support closer collaboration with large language models (LLMs).
